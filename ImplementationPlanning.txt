Planning and Implementation of Grade Calculator

Name: Gradulator? (Subject to change)

This app will be designed based on the Model View Controller architecthure 

Purpose of the App
------------------------------
This app will be able to track a user's grade per course showing their current grade in a course, a goal they have set,
and lastly the averages they will need to achieve those goals. 

The app wil be very flexible, Users will be able to easily adjust and change their goal to see the averages they will need for many
situtions. 
For example:
    Users will be able to see what their current grade is after recieving a mark for a test, midterm, quiz, assignment, etc. While at
    The same time see what scores they will need for upcoming evaluations in order to reciece a grade that they have set as their goal.

Users will input the items on their syllabus for a given course, as well as the syllabus item's weight towards their final grade. This will
allow flexibility of our system since not every course's syllabus is the same.

Functionality

This app must be quick and easy to use. User's often times use their calculators to find out this information, this app will release them
from that obligation and do all the calculations for them. User's must feel that it's worth using the app over a simple calculator, therefore, 
the app must be quick and easy to use.
